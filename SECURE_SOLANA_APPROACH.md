## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓ HTTP requests
Backend (Node.js/Express)
    ↓ @solana/web3.js
Solana Blockchain (Devnet)
```

**All Solana code lives in backend!**

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend manages wallets
### 2. Frontend calls backend APIs
### 3. Backend signs transactions
### 4. Users identified by account IDs (not wallet addresses)

This is being implemented now...
